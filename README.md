# [Project 1: Clustering of Yale face images and Amazon book review Semantic Aanalysis]
### coding language: Python
For this project, I explored different clustering algorithms on both image data and text data. Clustering algorithms explored include partition-based (K-Means), Hierarchical and Density-based (DBSCAN). Different metrics on distance and similarities have also been explored and compared with regards to clustering performance. Given the labels of all the data are known, external metrics e.g. purity, completeness and pair-wise measurements have been explored.




# [Project 2: Heart Disease Risk Prediction]
### coding language: Python
Data source: UCI Cleverland Heart Disease Dataset
For this project, I explored a couple of classifier algorithms, compaired performance and important features of different models. Applying SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) values as a unified approach to interpreting model predictions for individual case. This capability can be applied to assist clinicians to scrutinize which risk factors, by how much, lead to the high probability of heart disease for the patient.


# [Project 3: US Counties Health Rankings Aanalysis]
### coding language: R
2018 County Health Ranking Data from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, granted us a great opportunity to take a closer look at the ultimate health outcomes and the potentially correlated factors. These data enabled us to scrutinize the inequalities and disparities in health outcomes and factors across the United States.
